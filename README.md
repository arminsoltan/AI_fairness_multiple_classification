## AI Fairness Multiple Classification
In this project we examine different deep learning models on AIM AHEAD dataset. We showed bias existed in different deep learning then we used Hardt model to mitigate bias across different demographic groups. 
For those samples we had fp or tp equals zero we added them up with epsilon value 0.001 to prevent segmentation fault.
